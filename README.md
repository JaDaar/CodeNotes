CodeNotes 2018
==============
I write a lot of code, and in my career I have had to re-use the same function or routine
many times in many different situations.

Thank goodness for Google, but in many cases, I re-write perfectly good code from project 
to project to do perform similar purposes.  Encapsulation of strings in single quotes properly,
or regez email validation routines.

So I wrote this app, more like I have written it again - like the 5th incarnation of it, to store
those gems or items I want to save and reuse again.

This version will save information into SQL Server.  
It is written using AngularJS.
